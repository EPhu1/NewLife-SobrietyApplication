# NewLife-SobrietyApplication

I made this application to help people that I know who have problems with alcohol and substance addiction. This application is a sobriety tracker that encourages people to 
rehabilitate by constantly showing milestones, savings, motivation, and more. 

I programmed this using React Native, Javascript, CSS, and HTML. 
I used Redux to efficiently store all my information and make the files as clean as possible.
I used AsyncStorage to store the data locally, which allows the user to keep track of their sobriety without needing access to the internet.
